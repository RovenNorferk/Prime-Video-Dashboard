# Prime Video Content Dashboard

## Situation

Prime Video, as a leading streaming platform, offers a vast catalog of movies and TV shows from around the world. Analyzing its content library provides valuable insights into global trends, genre preferences, ratings, and regional representation. To address this need, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze Prime Video’s extensive content library.

## Task

As a data analyst, my task was to design a dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

- Explore the distribution of shows across different countries.
- Analyze the top genres and their popularity.
- Understand content availability by type, ratings, and release year.
- Provide detailed information on specific titles, including their cast and descriptions.

## Action

### Features of the Dashboard

#### 1. **Global Content Distribution**
- A world map displaying the total number of shows available by country, with clear differentiation through shading and numerical labels.

#### 2. **Content Details**
- Title-specific details, including genre, release year, duration, cast, and description.
- Dynamic filtering options for type, genre, and title.

#### 3. **Ratings Analysis**
- A radial chart showcasing the distribution of content across various rating categories (e.g., "13+", "16+", "ALL").

#### 4. **Top Genres**
- A horizontal bar chart highlighting the top 10 genres based on the number of shows.

#### 5. **Content Type Breakdown**
- A pie chart illustrating the percentage split between movies and TV shows. Movies account for 80.82% of the catalog, while TV shows make up 19.18%.

#### 6. **Historical Trends**
- A line chart showing the growth in the number of shows by release year and type (movies vs. TV shows).

## Result

The Prime Video Content Dashboard provides actionable insights into the platform’s extensive library:

- **Content Distribution**: Identify regions with the highest number of shows to plan content strategies.
- **Genre Popularity**: Understand audience preferences with a breakdown of top genres.
- **Ratings Analysis**: Analyze ratings to target specific demographics effectively.
- **Content Trends**: Leverage historical release patterns for future acquisitions and production planning.

## Reflection

This project enhanced my expertise in designing visually appealing and insightful dashboards. It emphasized the importance of combining multiple visual elements to present a cohesive story. In the future, I aim to incorporate user feedback and real-time updates to further improve the dashboard's utility.
